    <h2>Webstock '14: Designing with Details</h2>
    <h3>Dan Saffer</h3> 
    
        <a href="http://http://vimeo.com/album/2784294/video/89543518"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a>
        <p>What I learned from this video is that paying attention to details when designing products, applications, or websites, is extremely important when trying to attract users and viewers. The easiness of user accesibility and navigation is crucial when designing products or websites. I learned not to overlook the simple things because sometimes the simple things are the reasons people do not like your product. Basically, every detail is important. I thought the speaker was very captivating and made a good case for his arguement when he talked about "Don't start from zero, bring data forward, what is often overlooked, and long loops." He states that products are good when they are responsive based on previous user experience. </p>
        <ul>
        <li>How to change a product from tolerated to beloved.</li>
        <li>What microinteractions are: Triggers, Rules, Feedbacks, and Loops.</li>
        <li>How important user navigation icons are.</li> 
        </ul>

      <h2>Webstock '13: How Designers Destroyed the World</h2>
    <h3>Mike Monteiro</h3> 
    <a href="http://http://vimeo.com/68470326"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a> 
    <p>Throughout the video, Mike Monteiro talks about the importance and responsiblity that comes with being a designer. He believes that designers should be passionate, have a vision, have an end goal, be proud and care for what they create. He also mentions that being a designer isn't easy. People will be better than you, and you will be better then other, and that all designers will make mistaks. Overall, Monteiro is basically saying it's not just the content that is important for the designing aspect, imagination is impoortant as well. He wants designers to recognize the power the have and to use it successfully and thoughtfully. 
    </p> 
    <ul>
        <li>Design is your job, not your clients. Do not put the work on them.</li>
        <li>When something is badly designed and potentially harmful, you have one of three possible situations: ignore it, run it up the chain, the chain of command ignored.</li>
        <li>Bad design makes it out into the World not through malicious intent but through no intent at all.</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Mobile First</h2>
    <h3>Luke Wroblewski</h3> 
            <a href="http://vimeo.com/38187066"><strong>VIDEO</strong></a> 

    <p>Luke Wroblewski talks about the current trends in mobile devices. He provides data that shows more and more people are surfing the web through mobile devices. Based on the increasing mobile internet usage, Wroblewski believes that web designers should design with the idea of "mobile first" in mind. He then talks about constraints, meaning, designers have to redesign based on screen sizes and formatting. Therefore, one has to know their audeince and figure out what content is important.

        <li>Constraints=Focus</li>
